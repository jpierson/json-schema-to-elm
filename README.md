# JSON schema to Elm

An elm package for generating Elm JSON decoders from JSON Schema. The initial goals are to attempt to port the [dragonwasrobot/json-schema-to-elm](https://github.com/dragonwasrobot/json-schema-to-elm) project written in Elixir to Elm and publish as a package that can be used in Elm applications or perhaps as a CLI tool installed via NPM.

## Contributions

Please feel free to contribute in the form of Pull Requests, issues, or packaging guidance. This is my first attempt to contribute a library to the Open Source Elm package space so any assistance is welcome. If you live in the Detroit Michigan area then you may also be interested in joining the monthly hack nights held by the [Detroit-Elm](https://www.meetup.com/elm-detroit/) meetup where we may be collaborating periodically on [this related project](https://github.com/Elm-Detroit/elm-detroit/issues/5).
